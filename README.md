## Description
Donation Button is an extension to the phpBB bulletin board (**version 3.2.0 and later**) which adds a donation button (e.g. PayPal) at a selectable position
(one position only) of your board's template.  
In the ACP you can select this position and the horizontal alignment within Donation Button's display bar which looks like the navigation or the footer bar.
In addition you can (must) enter the HTML code representing the button itself and you can enter a short legend (e.g. `Donate to the board's operation`); please
read the explanations for the individual settings.  
This extension adds a new permission to phpBB's permission system allowing the admin to decide who can see the Donation Button, please set the permissions
according to your preferences.
  
## Installation
Copy all files and directories into a directory named `/ext/amot/donationbutton` and go the the ACP's customasition tab to activate this extension.
